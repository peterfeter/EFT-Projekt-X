# LoneEFT by Dreadful

Forked from Mambo - I'll update with changes I like from time to time but mainly will pull from Mambo and add the visual colors back in as well as my version of the loot widget. 

## Current Changes

Rotated maps to match orientation of online maps.

Added elevation arrows.

My version of the Mambo loot widget (Sort by Name or Price using N and P key's on radar PC)

Added visual colors to Color Picker, Loot Filter, and Cham vischeck colors

ESP Ammo Counter is LimeGreen - Can be changed in SKPain.cs

Flea Prices on loot update every 4HR's - Price updates are for PvE - You can change this in TarkovDevCores.cs by removing (gameMode:pve) on line 22. - This update is from LONE

## Future Changes

Any updates Mambo makes
